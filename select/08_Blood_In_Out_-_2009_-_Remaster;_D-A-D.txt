Yeah, I've changed but I kept my name
To retell a joke, it won't be the same
My eyes burn new black hollow holes
My fate's revealed my future's told
Mercurychrome.
Waitin', when the wound's scraped raw
Bones...
The biggest stitches that you ever wore
Blood in blood out Feel your past unwind
Blood in blood out Through sweat'n'hair
Blood in blood out My anorexic mind
Blood in blood out Gaspin' for air

I'm all right, I'm habituated
So I tip my hand, afraid to play it.
And then my ribs goes twang
- And off they fly.
It wasn't meant for human eyes
Let it go...
Yeah, another life, another form
Slow...
But, nothing happens when it comes along
Blood in blood out Feel your past unwind
Blood in blood out Through sweat'n'hair
Blood in blood out My anorexic mind
Blood in blood out Gaspin' for air

Check my heart'n'respiration
I feel I look a little pale
I just missed another station
- I'm stepping off the carousel...
Blood in blood out...
